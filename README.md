# hadUK-netCDF-to-json

Basic script to convert hadUK (https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/data/haduk-grid/haduk-grid) netCDF files to json, this is an initial example for sun by month data.

I'm a casual coder so this is a WiP and will try and make it more generic. Pull requests welcome.
